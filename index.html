          <p>
            The American film director Timothy William Burton was born on 25
            August 1958 in Burbank, California. From his early teens, he
            developed a passion for drawing, painting and fantasy film making
            his filmmaking career started by making short films in his parent's
            backyard with crude '8mm' film without sound. He joined the Disney
            animation team in 1979 after graduating from the California
            Institute of the Arts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although his already highly distinctive universe did not quite
            correspond to the Disney style of animation, the studio recognised
            his talent and participated in the production of his first short
            films: Vincent (1982), Hansel and Gretel (1983) and Frankenweenie
            (1984). He became an iconic film director, producer, writer, artist,
            and animator.
